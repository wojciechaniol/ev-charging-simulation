## 🔮 Future Enhancements (Optional)

While the dashboard is feature-complete, these could be added:

1. **WebSocket Integration** - True push notifications instead of polling
2. **Payment Gateway** - Credit card processing
3. **Route Planning** - GPS navigation to CP
4. **Reservation System** - Book charging slots ahead
5. **Mobile App** - Native iOS/Android apps
6. **Social Features** - Share and rate CPs
7. **Vehicle Integration** - Direct battery status from car API
8. **Carbon Tracking** - Environmental impact metrics
9. **Multi-vehicle** - Manage multiple EVs per driver
10. **Push Notifications** - Mobile/desktop notifications

---

## 📝 Technical Notes

### Architecture Decisions
- **Polling vs WebSocket**: Used polling for simplicity and reliability
- **In-memory Storage**: Session history stored in memory (use DB for production)
- **Central Integration**: Direct HTTP polling to central controller
- **Favorites Storage**: Driver-local set for quick access

### Performance
- **Latency**: Sub-second response times
- **Scalability**: Supports multiple concurrent drivers
- **Update Frequency**: Configurable polling intervals
- **Memory Usage**: Minimal with session history limits

### Security
- **Driver Isolation**: Each driver only sees own sessions
- **Endpoint Validation**: Driver ID verification on all endpoints
- **CORS Enabled**: Allows web dashboard access
- **No Authentication**: Add OAuth2/JWT for production
