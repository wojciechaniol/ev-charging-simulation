‚úÖ CP CP-001 recovered from fault
```

**Shows:**

### Driver Client Terminals

```
üì§ driver-alice requested charging at CP-001
‚úÖ driver-alice | CP-001 | ACCEPTED
üîã driver-alice | CP-001 | IN_PROGRESS | 22.0 kW, ‚Ç¨0.01
‚úîÔ∏è  driver-alice | CP-001 | COMPLETED
‚ùå driver-bob | CP-002 | DENIED | CP not available
```

**Shows:**
- Charging requests with timing
- Response status (ACCEPTED, DENIED, IN_PROGRESS, COMPLETED)
- Real-time charging progress
- Cost accumulation
- Request intervals and retry logic

## üîÑ Autonomous Operation Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Happy Path (Successful Charging)

**Timeline:**
1. Driver sends request for available CP
2. Central validates and accepts
3. Central commands CP to start charging
4. CP transitions to SUPPLYING state
5. Telemetry flows every second for ~10 seconds
6. Charging completes automatically
7. CP returns to ACTIVATED state
8. Driver receives COMPLETED status
9. Driver waits interval and requests next CP

### Scenario 2: Concurrent Charging

With 5 drivers and 10 CPs, you'll frequently see:
- Multiple CPs in SUPPLYING state simultaneously
- Up to 10 concurrent charging sessions
- Real-time telemetry from multiple CPs
- Different power/cost rates across sessions
- Load distribution across the CP network

### Scenario 3: CP Unavailable (Already Assigned)

**When a CP is busy:**
1. Driver B requests CP-001 (already used by Driver A)
2. Central checks CP-001 state ‚Üí SUPPLYING
3. Central responds with DENIED status
4. Driver B waits and retries with next CP
5. System continues without interruption

### Scenario 4: Health Check Failure (Automatic Fault Detection)

**If a CP becomes unresponsive:**
1. Monitor detects 3 consecutive health check failures (< 6 seconds)
2. Monitor notifies Central: CP is FAULTY
3. Central marks CP as unavailable
4. Circuit breaker prevents new assignments to faulty CP
5. Existing sessions may complete if already started
6. When CP recovers, monitor detects healthy status
7. Monitor notifies Central: CP recovered
8. Central clears fault flag
9. CP becomes available for new requests

## üìà Expected Behavior Metrics

| Metric | Expected Value |
|--------|---------------|
| **Startup Time** | 30-45 seconds to full operation |
| **Request Latency** | < 100ms (request ‚Üí ACCEPTED) |
| **Telemetry Rate** | 1 Hz per active CP |
| **Health Check Interval** | Every 2 seconds |
| **Session Duration** | ~10 seconds |
| **Concurrent Sessions** | Up to 10 (one per CP) |
| **Fault Detection** | < 6 seconds (3 failures √ó 2s) |
| **Requests Per Minute** | ~60-80 total (all drivers combined) |
