## Starting the System

### Quick Start

```bash
# Start all 26 services
docker compose up -d

# Wait 30 seconds for initialization
sleep 30

# Verify all services are running
docker compose ps
```

### Expected Output

All services should show status: `Up` or `Up (healthy)`

```
NAME                IMAGE                        STATUS
ev-central          ...                          Up
ev-cp-e-1           ...                          Up
ev-cp-e-2           ...                          Up
...
ev-driver-alice     ...                          Up
ev-driver-bob       ...                          Up
...
```

## Observing the System

### Method 1: Dashboard (Visual)

**Access the web dashboard:**
```
http://localhost:8000
```

**What you'll see:**
- Real-time charging point states (color-coded badges)
- Active charging sessions with driver info
- Live telemetry: kW delivered and cost in ‚Ç¨
- Auto-refresh every 2 seconds

### Method 2: Terminal Logs (Detailed)

Use the provided `view-logs.sh` script for organized log viewing:

```bash
# View all service logs together
./view-logs.sh all

# View only Central controller logs
./view-logs.sh central

# View only Charging Point engine logs
./view-logs.sh cp

# View only Monitor logs
./view-logs.sh monitor

# View only Driver logs
./view-logs.sh driver
```

**Or use docker compose directly:**

```bash
# All services
docker compose logs -f

# Specific service
docker compose logs -f ev-central
docker compose logs -f ev-cp-e-1
docker compose logs -f ev-driver-alice
```

## What to Observe

### 1. Central Controller Terminal

**Key Events:**
```
‚úÖ Driver request received: driver=driver-alice, cp=CP-001
‚úÖ CP CP-001 registered successfully
‚úÖ Assigned driver-alice to CP-001

## Typical Autonomous Flow

### Happy Path (Successful Charging)

**Timeline:**
1. **T+0s** - System starts, all services initialize
2. **T+5s** - Kafka ready, services connect
3. **T+10s** - Monitors register CPs with Central
4. **T+15s** - All CPs in ACTIVATED state
5. **T+20s** - driver-alice sends request for CP-001
6. **T+21s** - Central validates and accepts request
7. **T+22s** - Central sends START_SUPPLY to CP-001
8. **T+23s** - CP-001 transitions to SUPPLYING state
9. **T+24-33s** - Telemetry flows every second
10. **T+34s** - Charging completes (10 seconds)
11. **T+35s** - CP-001 transitions back to ACTIVATED
12. **T+36s** - driver-alice receives COMPLETED status
13. **T+41s** - driver-alice requests next CP

**What you observe:**
```
[ev-driver-alice] üì§ Requested charging at CP-001
[ev-central] Driver request received: driver-alice, cp=CP-001
[ev-central] Assigned driver-alice to CP-001
[ev-cp-e-1] ACTIVATED ‚Üí SUPPLYING
[ev-cp-e-1] Telemetry: 22.0 kW, ‚Ç¨0.006
[ev-driver-alice] üîã IN_PROGRESS | 22.0 kW, ‚Ç¨0.01
...
[ev-cp-e-1] Session completed. Total: 0.06 kWh, ‚Ç¨0.02
[ev-cp-e-1] SUPPLYING ‚Üí ACTIVATED
[ev-driver-alice] ‚úîÔ∏è COMPLETED
```

### Concurrent Charging (Multiple Drivers)

With 5 drivers and different request intervals, you'll see:

**Overlapping Sessions:**
```
[ev-central] Active sessions: 5
  - driver-alice at CP-001 (3s remaining)
  - driver-bob at CP-003 (7s remaining)
  - driver-charlie at CP-005 (9s remaining)
  - driver-david at CP-007 (2s remaining)
  - driver-eve at CP-002 (5s remaining)
```

**Dashboard view:**
- Multiple green "SUPPLYING" badges
- 5 active charging session cards
- Real-time telemetry for all active sessions

### Fault Scenario (Health Check Failure)

**If a CP becomes unresponsive:**

```
[ev-cp-m-1] ‚ö†Ô∏è  Health check failed (1) for CP-001
[ev-cp-m-1] ‚ö†Ô∏è  Health check failed (2) for CP-001
[ev-cp-m-1] ‚ùå Health check failed (3) for CP-001
[ev-cp-m-1] Notifying Central: CP-001 is FAULTY
[ev-central] Marked CP-001 as faulty
[ev-driver-alice] ‚ùå CP-001 | DENIED | CP not available
```

**When CP recovers:**

```
[ev-cp-m-1] ‚úÖ Health check passed for CP-001
[ev-cp-m-1] Notifying Central: CP-001 recovered
[ev-central] Cleared fault for CP-001
[ev-driver-alice] ‚úÖ CP-001 | ACCEPTED
```

### CP Not Available (Already in Use)

```
[ev-driver-bob] üì§ Requested charging at CP-001
[ev-central] CP-001 already assigned to driver-alice
[ev-driver-bob] ‚ùå CP-001 | DENIED | CP not available
[ev-driver-bob] Waiting 6.0s before next request...
```

## Continuous Operation

### Request Loop

Each driver continuously cycles through the `requests.txt` file:

**requests.txt (20 CPs):**
```
CP-001, CP-006, CP-002, CP-007, CP-003, CP-008, CP-004, CP-009, CP-005, CP-010
CP-001, CP-002, CP-003, CP-004, CP-005, CP-006, CP-007, CP-008, CP-009, CP-010
```

**Behavior:**
- After completing request 20, driver loops back to request 1
- Different request intervals create realistic concurrency
- System runs indefinitely until stopped

### Autonomous Testing Scenarios

The system automatically demonstrates:

‚úÖ **Concurrent charging** - Multiple drivers charging simultaneously  
‚úÖ **Request queuing** - Drivers wait when CPs are busy  
‚úÖ **State transitions** - All state machine paths exercised  
‚úÖ **Telemetry streaming** - Real-time power and cost updates  
‚úÖ **Health monitoring** - Continuous CP health checks  
‚úÖ **Fault detection** - Automatic fault detection and recovery  
‚úÖ **Session lifecycle** - Complete charging session from start to finish  
‚úÖ **Load distribution** - Requests spread across 10 CPs  
‚úÖ **Circuit breaker** - Prevents requests to faulty CPs  

## Stopping the System

### Graceful Shutdown

```bash
# Stop all services gracefully
docker compose down

# Stop and remove volumes (clean slate)
docker compose down -v
```

### Restart

```bash
# Restart all services
docker compose restart

# Or stop and start fresh
docker compose down
docker compose up -d
```

## Verification

### Quick Health Check

```bash
# Check all services are running
docker compose ps

# Check Central is responding
curl http://localhost:8000/health

# Check CP list
curl http://localhost:8000/cp | jq

# Check telemetry
curl http://localhost:8000/telemetry | jq
```

### Automated Verification Script

```bash
./verify.sh
```

**Checks performed:**
- ‚úì All containers running
- ‚úì Kafka broker accessible
- ‚úì Central controller responding
- ‚úì Charging points registered
- ‚úì No critical errors in logs

## Troubleshooting

### Services Not Starting

```bash
# Check logs for errors
docker compose logs

# Restart specific service
docker compose restart ev-central

# Full reset
docker compose down -v
docker compose up -d
```

### Kafka Connection Issues

```bash
# Check Kafka is running
docker compose ps kafka

# Check Kafka logs
docker compose logs kafka

# Restart Kafka
docker compose restart kafka
```

### CPs Not Registering

```bash
# Check monitor logs
docker compose logs ev-cp-m-1

# Verify Central is accessible
curl http://localhost:8000/health

# Check network connectivity
docker network inspect ev-charging-simulation_evcharging-network
```
