# 🛠️ Incident-Free Startup - Issue Resolution

## Issues Identified & Resolved

### Issue 1: Kafka Health Check Failure ❌ → ✅ FIXED

**Problem:**
```bash
$ docker inspect ev-kafka
Health: "unhealthy"
Error: kafka-broker-api-versions.sh: not found
```

The Kafka container was serving traffic but remained marked as `unhealthy` because the health check script didn't exist in the Apache Kafka 3.7.0 image.

**Solution:**
Updated Kafka health check in `docker-compose.yml` to use `netcat` (nc) which is available in the base image:

```yaml
healthcheck:
  test: ["CMD-SHELL", "nc -z localhost 9092 || exit 1"]
  interval: 10s
  timeout: 5s
  retries: 10
  start_period: 40s
```

**Result:**
```bash
$ docker inspect ev-kafka --format='{{.State.Health.Status}}'
healthy
```

✅ **Kafka now reports healthy status**

---

### Issue 2: KafkaConnectionError During Startup ❌ → ✅ FIXED

**Problem:**
Services were attempting to connect to Kafka before it was ready, resulting in fatal error stack traces:

```python
aiokafka.errors.KafkaConnectionError: KafkaConnectionError: Unable to bootstrap from [('kafka', 9092, <AddressFamily.AF_UNSPEC: 0>)]
    File "/app/evcharging/common/kafka.py", line 107, in ensure_topics
      await admin.start()
    File "/usr/local/lib/python3.11/site-packages/aiokafka/admin/client.py", line 137, in start
      await self._client.bootstrap()
```

Services would restart and eventually succeed, but these stack traces violated the "no incident" requirement.

**Solution:**

#### 1. Created Kafka Wait Script (`wait-for-kafka.sh`)
```bash
#!/bin/sh
# Wait for Kafka to be ready before starting application services

set -e

host="$1"
shift
max_attempts="${KAFKA_WAIT_MAX_ATTEMPTS:-30}"
wait_seconds="${KAFKA_WAIT_SECONDS:-2}"

echo "⏳ Waiting for Kafka at $host to be ready..."
echo "   Max attempts: $max_attempts, Wait interval: ${wait_seconds}s"

attempt=0
until nc -z ${host%%:*} ${host##*:} 2>/dev/null; do
  attempt=$((attempt + 1))
  if [ $attempt -ge $max_attempts ]; then
    echo "❌ Kafka at $host did not become available after $max_attempts attempts"
    exit 1
  fi
  
  if [ $((attempt % 5)) -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "   Still waiting... (attempt $attempt/$max_attempts)"
  fi
  
  sleep $wait_seconds
done

echo "✅ Kafka at kafka:9092 is ready!"
echo "🚀 Starting application: $@"

exec "$@"
```

#### 2. Updated All Dockerfiles

Added to all service Dockerfiles (`Dockerfile.central`, `Dockerfile.cp_e`, `Dockerfile.cp_m`, `Dockerfile.driver`):

**Installation:**
```dockerfile
# Install netcat for Kafka readiness check
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \
    gcc \
    netcat-openbsd \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Copy wait-for-kafka script
COPY wait-for-kafka.sh /usr/local/bin/wait-for-kafka.sh
RUN chmod +x /usr/local/bin/wait-for-kafka.sh
```

**Updated CMD:**
```dockerfile
# Before
CMD ["python", "-m", "evcharging.apps.ev_central.main"]

# After
CMD ["wait-for-kafka.sh", "kafka:9092", "python", "-m", "evcharging.apps.ev_central.main"]
```

**Result:**

Clean startup logs showing wait mechanism:
```
⏳ Waiting for Kafka at kafka:9092 to be ready...
   Max attempts: 30, Wait interval: 2s
✅ Kafka at kafka:9092 is ready!
🚀 Starting application: python -m evcharging.apps.ev_central.main
2025-10-22 17:52:00 | INFO | Central | Starting EV Central Controller...
2025-10-22 17:52:00 | INFO | Central | Created topics: [...]

```

✅ **ZERO KafkaConnectionError occurrences across all services**
