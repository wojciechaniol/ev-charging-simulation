2025-10-22 17:26:54 | INFO    | CP_M:CP-001 | Fault notification sent to Central
2025-10-22 17:26:56 | INFO    | CP_M:CP-001 | Health restored
```

✅ **Autonomous fault detection and recovery operational**

## Validation Through Terminal Observation

### ✅ What Can Be Validated:

1. **Driver Terminals** show:
   - Request sequence numbers (1/12, 2/12, etc.)
   - Request IDs (req-xxxxxxxx)
   - Acceptance/denial status
   - Waiting times between requests
   - Completion confirmations

2. **CP Engine Terminals** show:
   - State transitions (DISCONNECTED → ACTIVATED → SUPPLYING)
   - Command reception (START_SUPPLY, STOP_SUPPLY)
   - Session start/completion
   - Energy delivered (kWh)
   - Cost calculations (€)

3. **CP Monitor Terminals** show:
   - Health check status
   - Fault detection
   - Recovery notifications
   - Registration attempts

4. **Central Terminal** shows:
   - CP registrations
   - Driver request reception
   - Command issuance to CPs
   - Overall system orchestration

## Conclusion

✅ **System Requirements Met:**

1. ✅ **No user interaction required** - System starts and operates autonomously
2. ✅ **10+ services** - Running 15 services (Kafka, Central, 5 CPs, 5 Monitors, 3 Drivers)
3. ✅ **Terminal validation** - All activity visible in respective terminal logs
4. ✅ **Central handles multiple CPs/Drivers** - Processing concurrent requests from 3 drivers across 5 CPs
5. ✅ **No failures during normal execution** - All services running stable
6. ✅ **Lab deployment ready** - No compilation environments needed

**Status**: 🎉 **PRODUCTION READY FOR LAB DEPLOYMENT**
